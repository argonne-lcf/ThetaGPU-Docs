# GPU Monitoring

Each GPU on ThetaGPU hosts 8 A100 GPUs.  You can see information about these GPUs via the command `nvidia-smi`.

Each GPU has 40 GB of on-GPU memory.  When you run applications, you will know the GPU is in use when you see the memory increase and the GPU Utilization will be non-zero.

You can target a specific GPU with `nvidia-smi -i 0` for the first GPU, for example.

# GPU Selection

In many application codes, you may want to specifiy which GPU is used.  This is particular important in node-sharing applications where each GPU is running it's own code, which can be either in data-parallel model training, workflow based throughput jobs, etc.  You can control individual process launches with:

```bash
# Specify to run only on GPU 4:
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4

# Let your application see GPUS 0, 1, and 7:
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,7"
```

In these cases, the GPU orderings will appear as a consecutive list starting with 0.

From inside an application, many software frameworks have ability to let you target specific GPUs, including TensorFlow and PyTorch:
